Azure Devops provides multiple development collaboration tools. For this Workshop we will be using the following tools to create a high performant, resilient, self- healing pipeline:
*Azure Repos:* Source control repository for the test application. You can read more on Azure Repos [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/?view=vsts). 
*Azure Pipelines:* Creating CI/CD pipelines for deploying the test application. You can read more on Azure Devops Pipelines [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/index?view=vsts).
